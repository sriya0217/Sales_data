ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning Steps

Loaded dataset from CSV using Latin-1 encoding.
Checked for missing values using .isnull().sum().
Dropped all rows with any missing values using .dropna().
Converted ORDERDATE to a proper date format, removing the time component.
Removed the ADDRESSLINE2 column (if present).
Filled missing values in STATE, POSTALCODE, and TERRITORY with "Unknown".
Dropped duplicate rows to ensure unique entries.
Reset the DataFrame index after row removals.
Cleaned column headers by:
Stripping whitespace,
Converting to lowercase,
Replacing spaces with underscores,
Removing special characters.

Saved the cleaned dataset as an Excel file:
